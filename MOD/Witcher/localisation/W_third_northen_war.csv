EVTNAMEtnw.1;Velen aftermath;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.1;The Battle of Velen ended inconclusively, we stopped the Nilfgardians but suffered heavy losses. The Emperor will return soon with reinforcements. We must quickly rebuild our army to face the invaders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.1;Eternal Fire will support our war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.1;We need to find allies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.2;Legacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.2;The North is falling, our last opponent Radovid has been able to slow our march, but soon he will also be destroyed and the whole known world will be united under the Nilfgaard sun. But what will come next? You have no legitimate heir, after your death the empire will be divided among the minor lords and your legacy will be lost. But perhaps there is someone who could take over from you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.2;I must find my daughter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.100;Temerian aid;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.100;After the death of King Foltest, his kingdom disintegrated. The divided nobility could not resist the invasion from the south. Now all of Temeria is under the control of the Nilfgaard, and Emhyr sits on the throne in Wyzim. However, there are still people loyal to the old king, hoping to restore freedom to Temeria. Vernon Roche is ready to help us in our struggle against Emhyr, if we give him guarantees that after the war Temeria will keep its independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.100;Temeria will reclaim its freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.100;We will defeat the blacks without your help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.101;Skelige;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.101;An island country inhabited by pirates, strong warriors and men of honour. We never liked each other, but they definitely hate the Nilfgaardians and should understand that if we lose, they will be next in line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.101;Ask to join the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.101;We don't need pirates on our side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.102;Kovir and Poviss;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.102;During the Second Northern War, Kovir and Poviss maintained nutrality, but assisted us financially. We are the last obstacle standing between Nilfgaard and Kovir. Perhaps we could convince them to break their neutrality and join us before it is too late?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.102;Ask for support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.102;Redania will manage itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.200;Witch hunt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.200;Sorceresses, mages, witches and other users of magic are the reason why we find ourselves in the current situation. The Lodge of Sorceresses, under the leadership of Filippa, ordered the assassination of Foltest and Demavend, preparing the way for the Nilfgaard invasion. The recent Loc Muine summits have only shown that the wizards are power-hungry manipulators who plot against us. After these events, all the wizards associated with the Lodge are wanted, but perhaps we should take care of all the wizards?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.200;Leave them for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.200;Aresst everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTCtnw.200;Burn! Burn! Burn!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.201;Flaming Rose Order;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.201;During the first phase of the war, the Order of the Flaming Rose suffered devastating losses and is on the verge of collapse. Perhaps it no longer makes sense for the Order to stay in Redani if it can no longer offer us military support?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.201;Confiscate the property and incorporate the knights into Witch Hunters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.201;Maybe they will still prove useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTCtnw.201;Help them rebuild their strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.202;Keira Metz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.202;Who would have thought that a member of the Lodge of Sorceresses would come to me on her own? Keira Metz has brought behind her notes on Catriona plague and claims she can help us create a powerful weapon to fight Nilfgaard, in exchange for a pardon of her Lodge association.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.202;Perhaps you are the only sorceress we can trust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.202;I'll never trust a witch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTCtnw.202;Do you take me for a fool?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.203;Novigrad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.203;The Hierarch of Novigrad understood that we were the only ones who could stop the infidel armies from the south. With Novigrad's support we should win this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.203;Time to push the blacks out of the North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.300;Cobbler with a monocle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.300;After the fall of Temeria, the remnants of its army fought as guerrillas, or joined Radovid. However, there are also those who are willing to cooperate. Thaler, the head of Temerian intelligence, offered to help us destroy Radovid, if Temeria would get more autonomy after the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.300;Kill Radovid and you will get your freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.300;We don't need your help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTDESCtnw.302;Radovid is dead. Without him, Redania will not continue the fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.302;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.303;Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.303;Many years have passed since you last saw your daughter. She is now a grown woman. The witcher you hired has fulfilled his task. He brought your daughter before you. You invited her to your chamber for a private conversation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.303;Offer her to become empress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTDESCtnw.304;The girl did not take best to your proposal. She recalled that in the past you had wanted to kidnap her and kill her friends, and now you only remembered her when you needed her. She left indignantly and furiously from your chamber.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.304;Will I ever see her again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.305;Return of the Swallow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.305;The last time you saw her she was furious with you. But now she has rethought the matter and decided to accept your proposal. Ciri will become empress because she thinks she can do more good that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.305;Welcome home daughter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.305;Abdicate, and leave the ruling to your daughter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.400;The King is Dead;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.400;King Bran, former King of the Skellige Isles, lived a long and storied life. When he finally felt decrepitude taking a hold of him, he went into the woods to hunt a bear armed with only a knife â€“ and thus ended his reign. In keeping with our tradition, the time has come to elect a new king to lead us in these difficult times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.400;Hjalmar and Cerys will represent our Clan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.400;I should be the one to continue my father's legacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTCtnw.400;The gods have a different purpose for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTDtnw.400;Otrygg will represent our Clan..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTEtnw.400;Halbjorn will represent our Clan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTFtnw.400;I hope Lugos will not let me down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.401;Visitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.401;Cerys, the daughter of Crach has arrived on your island. She questioned you about the voices of the gods that you hear, and now she questions all the inhabitants of the island about you. Why does she have such curiosity?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.401;Interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.402;Brokvar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.402;Somehow Cerys found out about your story with your brother. She claims that the gods are speaking to you because they want you to reconcile with your brother. To this end, your ancestral sword must be given to Aki.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.402;Perhaps this is the will of the gods?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.402;Throw the sword into the sea? Thank you for such great ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.403;God's will;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.403;"You vile wretch. You didn't help Aki, and now you failed to sail out to beg his forgiveness. Poke out your eye. Suffer, and regret the evil you've wrought.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.403;May the gods forgive me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.404;Hym;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.404;Cerys kidnapped your son and had him thrown into the oven.... It seemed like the worst day of your life, but the moment your child was thrown into the oven, a "shadow" appeared in the room looking like a person. As it later turned out, it was a demon - Hym. When he left your body, Cerys appeared with your son, whole and healthy. The demon felt cheated and left your body once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.404;I feel... empty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.405;Kidnapper;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.405;Cerys an Craite was caught in an attempt to kidnap your son. She claims you were possessed and she needed your son to help you. An absurd explanation, she should be executed for this, but this will be met with an answer from her father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.405;Get off my island!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.405;You will pay for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.406;Udarlyk possesed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.406;For years, everyone on the islands believed that Udarlyk heard voices from the gods, claiming himself to be their chosen one. As it turned out, it was not the voices of the gods that he heard, but a demon that possessed him when he was young. With the help of Cerys an Crait the demon was driven away and Udarlyk regained his mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.406;Interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.407;Hjalmar the giantslayer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.407;Some time ago, Hjalmar an Crait gathered a drakkar of warriors and set off for Undvik to liberate the island from the rule of the ice giant. Today, news has reached us that Hjalmar has returned from his expedition, although almost all his companions were killed, but the giant was finally killed and Undvik liberated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.407;Finally some good news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.408;The Lord of Undvik;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.408;Some time ago, Hjalmar an Crait gathered a drakkar of warriors and set out for Undvik to liberate the island from the ice giant. Today, news has reached us that Hjalmar and his companions were killed during this expedition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.408;Bad news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.408;This is terrible news for the Crait...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.409;Cave of Dreams;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.409;It is said that whoever enters the Cave of Dreams will find there what they fear most. We have received news that young Lugos and his crew also went there and survived.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.409;Interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.421;King Hjalmar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.421;Weren't long ago we gave King Bran back to the sea. Today our mourning ends. Today, by the grace of the gods and the clans, a new ruler takes the crown. Let us swear him fealty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.421;Long live the King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.422;Queen Cerys;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.422;Weren't long ago we gave King Bran back to the sea. Today our mourning ends. Today, by the grace of the gods and the clans, a new ruler takes the crown. Let us swear her fealty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTOPTAtnw.424;Long live the King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.425;King Halbjorn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.425;Weren't long ago we gave King Bran back to the sea. Today our mourning ends. Today, by the grace of the gods and the clans, a new ruler takes the crown. Let us swear him fealty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.425;Long live the King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.426;King Svanrige;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.426;Weren't long ago we gave King Bran back to the sea. Today our mourning ends. Today, by the grace of the gods and the clans, a new ruler takes the crown. Let us swear him fealty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.426;Long live the King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.1000;Victory of the North;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.1000;Thanks to your tactical genius, Redania defeated the invader from the south. Now is the time to decide the fate of the North. Should we return to the old order before the war? Or should the North be united under your leadership? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.1000;The North is finally free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.1000;It's a bad day for the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTCtnw.1000;The North should unite under the redanian eagle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.1001;Conquest of North;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.1001;Redania's defeat ended the Third War of the North. The Nilfgaard Empire has achieved its goal, there is no one left who could oppose our power. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.1001;The world belongs to us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.1001;The North is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
